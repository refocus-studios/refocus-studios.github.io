# Another Day, Another Blog    

It’s funny how life unfolds sometimes.  I loved my Army time, but at times it wasn’t easy.  One pain point in particular was my time training to be a Civil Affairs officer.  

At first I was excited to be selected.  I had just come back from deployment and after a 8 month stop in Kentucky, I moved to Fayetteville, NC ready to start my new life. In effect, I was the youngest officer going into Civil Affairs training, and since I validated the 6 month language course, I was headed straight into the four month skill course.    

Within a short time at the course, I realized things weren’t perfect.  Having already spent a few years in the Army, that wasn’t too surprising.  Just like always, I sucked it up, complained among peers, and moved on.  The line I couldn’t cross was when the the schoolhouse leadership gathered all the students together and told us that we should expect to serve three years minimum and not the one year promised before being allowed to leave the Army.  To that I said no.  I fought it and knowingly created many enemies in the process. At one point, the schoolhouse Lt Col brought me into his office for the third time, and informed me that I had two choices;  1) Leave the Army now, 2) Finish the course and stop asking to leave.  I informed him that I couldn’t leave the Army, I still had years owed from West Point.  His response, “well, I guess that means your staying.”  That was one of those moments I didn’t think actually happened in real life.  

I digress though, this wasn’t supposed to be me about fighting the system.  I eventually made it out by agreeing to ‘fail’ the course and accepting a deployment that happened five months later.  This story is cool because I met a lot of great people and in particular made one friend who I kept running into. 

One of the guys I met at the school was a former Apache pilot named Jordan.  He had lived in Panama with his twin brother and I distinctly remember him talking about it. Starting West Point at seventeen, I thought it was awesome that somebody in the Army actually had time to ‘live’ anywhere other than where the Army told them.  He also had a desire not to be shackled by a three year commitment to the Army, but he wasn’t ready to start fighting the system.  When I finally got my release papers, he congratulated me and we went our separate ways.  

Fast forward 3 years and a deployment, and I found myself living in DC  working as a young consultant.  On a typical Thursday night, it’s probably two in the morning at a bar named Lima in downtown DC, and I run into Jordan while he is walking out.  He informed me that he did a little time in Civil Affairs and found his way out.  He was at the FBI academy in Quantico about to graduate.  His brother was already an agent and was stationed in San Juan.  We chatted a bit and went our separate ways. 

Fast forward 2 years later and I’m standing on my porch in San Juan.  I watch a Land Rover pull into the parking lot, and I swear I see Jordan walking out of the car.  After a bit, I head out for a walk and I see him on the balcony of a first floor apartment.  Turns out that the person on the balcony was his twin brother, but after the confusion settled his brother stated Jordan was inside.  Five years and three different places unplanned.  

Life is strange sometimes.  I wish there was more of a point to this blog, but I’m new at this.  Hopefully in time I can weave some more meaning into stories I write, like how you should always treat people like you will meet them again one day.  For now, it’s just a series of events I found interesting and figured I should share.
