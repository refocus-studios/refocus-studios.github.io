During Christmas, my parents came home with a brand new Samsung Surround Sound system.  Their previous system was either destroyed by the dog pissing on it, or condensation.  The debate is still ongoing.  

What ensued actually amazed me and got me really thinking about how companies market their products.  At first, I was adamant that they needed to get a Samsung branded system.  This was in the belief that a Samsung product would just work with their current Samsung TV. They ended up grabbing a $400 system at Sam's Club, not the price range I was expecting, but at least they went with Samsung.  

After helping hook it up, I spent the next four hours completely aggravated by the incompatibility and horrible sound coming out of the system.  At first I had to try and route all the auxiliary systems (AppleTV, DVD, etc) through the new sound receiver/dvd, and when I realized that just wasn't working, I had to hook it all back up they way it was before. 

Frustrated, I recommended they pack it up, take it back and buy a Bose system.  My Dad thought about it for a second, and then agreed. Adding that he normally wouldn't take that action due to the hassle, but it was the right thing to do.  So the next day, my Mom and I went to Sams Club and chose a Bose sound system at a cost of $430.  

Over a few hours, my Dad and I installed the system.  To be absolutely truthful here, my Dad did most of the work while I helped my Mom battle the ATT operator on the phone in pursuit of a new iPhone for her.  He installed the three speakers and five wires, and ensured the TV was set to external output in about 20 mins.  That was it, and it sounded great.  

I have no idea what Samsung was thinking here.  Java power 'Anynet+' branded software that syncs with your TV and disconnects at will.  Why?  

Here is to simplicity, Bose just worked and had great sound.  They excelled at meeting just what we needed, and for that reason, they are worth the money.  I think if Samsung owners truly understood what they were getting, they'd find themselves packing up their products and returning them to the store as well. Samsung is probably counting on the laziness of people to ensure their numbers stay high. Although they are probably doing it unintentionally.  Numbers don't always speak the truth if you are seeking to actually deliver good products.
